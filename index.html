        <div>
          <p>1. Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:<br />
            #<br />
            ##<br />
            ###<br />
            ####<br />
            #####<br />
            ######<br />
            #######<br /></p>  
          <p id="output">My Solution output:</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>2. Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3,
                print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.<br />
                When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5
                (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
            </p>
            <p id="fizzbuzz">My Solution output: <br /></p>
        </div>        
        
        

        <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
    </body>
